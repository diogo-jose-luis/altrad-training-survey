When you create a new folder in "app" directory has it is going to be automacally a name of a route for the convetion nextjs says that the file inside that folder must be named "page.tsx"

The name of component in file "page.tsx" doesnt really have to be the same as the name of file, you can put something more meaningfull to what the component represents.
